# SeedQueue

## Description

SeedQueue is a mod designed to replace multi-instancing in Minecraft. Instead of running multiple instances of Minecraft to generate worlds, SeedQueue allows you to do it all within a single instance. It features a built-in wall screen that can be configured through the SpeedrunAPI menu and further customized with resource packs. This significantly improves performance, especially on lower-end hardware, and makes speedrunning more accessible.
