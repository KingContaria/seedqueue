# SeedQueue
## Description
SeedQueue is a mod that is meant to replace multi-instancing. Instead of having multiple Minecrafts generating worlds open at the same time, it does it all in just one Minecraft instance as it has a built-in wall screen that can be configured through the SpeedrunAPI menu and further customized through resource packs. This greatly improves performance, especially for lower end hardware, and is also aimed to make speedrunning more accessible.
